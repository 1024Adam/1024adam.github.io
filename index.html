          <p>Hi! My name is Adam Reid. I am currently a fourth year Bachelors of Computing Co-op student, majoring in computer science. I have just completed my third co-op term of five, this time with the Hospitality Services department of the University of Guelph as an Application Developer. My interests are in back-end development, and information security. Some areas where I would like to expand my knowledge are in web development, and mobile app development.</p>
          <p>I am currently pursuing a minor in mathematics, which helps my ability to problem solve very easily. I apply this knowledge constantly in the programs that I develop.</p>
          <p>My goal for this website is to provide information and insight on what it is like to work in software development roles in different companies.</p>

        <h1>The Co-operators</h1>
        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>The Co-operators, is an insurance company that was formed in Canada in 1945. It was originally built by farmers to take care of themselves because traditional insurers did not meet their needs at the time. They provide a number of different services to this day, such as auto, home, and commercial insurance. Currently, The Co-operators have over a million clients across the Canada. I worked at the Co-operators head office, which is located in downtown Guelph, Ontario.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-10 jumbotron">
        <h2>About My Role</h2>
        <p>My main job at The Co-operators was as a Quality Assurance Analyst. I worked on a QA team of testers, along with the entire document solutions team, to ensure that all of the documents produced from the system were accurate, and correct. The system that produces these documents is called Guidewire PolicyCenter, so my main job was to ensure that all of the information that was entered in PolicyCenter correctly printed on the documents that will go out towards their clients. During my time there, our team thoroughly tested all aspect of the Automotive insurance documents, performing many different types of tests to do so, including system integration testing, regression testing, black box testing, and white box testing. Near the end of my term, I was asked to look into the possibility of using an program called Selenium to automate our testing process during the regression stages. By the end of my term, I had successfully created an automation script that simulates a policy being created using a set of data in an Excel document. This script will be used in the future, as they develop further into this program, and the benefits it can have on the teamâ€™s testing process.</p>
        <p>Another task that I was assigned to work on was the testing of a software upgrade called Prinova MessagePoint. This software was used, along with their Guidewire software, to produce the documents that my team reviewed. I was trusted to individually test this upgraded software, in order to ensure that it did not interfere with the correct composition of the policy documents. The testing for this upgrade took a total of about a month, which consisted of gathering information about the upgrade, gathering test samples, and performing all required test cases that I had created to be sure that the entire system worked with no difference to the previously upgraded one. By the end of the testing period, I successfully reported any and all defects found in my testing, had them fixed by the Prinova developers, and confirmed that all errors have been fixed.</p>

        <h1>The Co-operators</h1>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Through the first four months of my work term, the goals I made were pretty generic, and focused on essential skills that I knew would help me further on in my career as well. One of the goals I had was to improve on communicating my thoughts and opinions effectively to my fellow team members. A method for completing this goal was to actively participate more in group meetings and discussions. Another goal I had was to develop better testing strategies by exploring unique and creative ways to test software efficiently. One way I would achieve this goal was to use a variety of new testing strategies and techniques learned by shadowing other team members while they test. My third goal was to collaborate with team members to accomplish more difficult tasks. Throughout the term, I actively participated in many group projects, which helped me to accomplish this goal. The last term specific goal that I had for the summer was to learn and develop a better understanding of software testing techniques and methodologies. Thanks to my manager Venkat, who lead many different learning sessions for the team, I was able to achieve this goal very quickly.</p>
        <p>Through the second half of my work term, the goals I made were more specific to the type of job I would be doing. My first goal was to summarize my work at the Co-operators, to help me reflect on my experiences and learning throughout my work term. With the help of Venkat, I was thankfully able to learn a lot, which I incorporated into my summary. Another goal I had was to independently perform the testing on a small project. My job was to test that all documents were produced as expected during a software upgrade. I was responsible for completing a test plan, test cases, defect reporting, and conducting the test cases, in order to ensure that the software worked correctly. The third goal I had was to create an automated test script, which will eventually be used as a template so then automated testing can be used on a regular basis during regression testing. I successfully created and demonstrated my test case script automation, which produced a policy based on a set of data, along with a couple other useful automated test scripts as well.</p>
        <p>One goal that I made throughout my entire work term was to learn more about corporate work culture, and specifically the work culture at The Co-operators. In order to achieve this goal, I completed courses on The Co-operators learning website, as well as I participated in learning sessions provided, and researched more about the topic in my free time. This definitely helped me to  better understand the true benefits of working in a corporate company, and the Co-operators industry work culture.</p>
        <p>Overall, each one of the goals that I made and completed helped me to get the most learning out of my time while I was there. My co-workers were very supportive of my goals, and were willing to provide help, advice and knowledge whenever possible.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In Conclusion, working at The Co-operators was definitely a great experience for me. Not only did I make a lot of connections with my co-workers there, but I also gained valuable experience with learning better test methods and strategies. Knowing the importance of thoroughly testing code was one of the most significant things I took away from working there. One reason why I chose to work at The Co-operators was because I thought that it would be a good job to start with. Another reason is because I thought it would teach me how to test my code properly, and it definitely did exactly that. I am already applying what I learned there into my school work, and my personal coding projects, and I am sure that I will definitely help me in the future as well.</p>

        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>Hospitality Services is the department in the University of Guelph, and is a recognized leader for quality and innovation in Canadian University food services. The Hospitality Services IT department deals with a variety of different jobs, including ensuring that meal cards are working, and processing transactions made on a daily basis. They offer many different plans to accommodate both students, and faculty, which definitely makes it a very significant department within the University of Guelph.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-10 jumbotron">
        <h2>About My Role</h2>
        <p>One thing that was particularly different about the role I had was that I was the sole individual responsible for both the development and testing that I completed in my work term. Being in this situation provided me with a lot of work to do, and a lot of responsibility as well. This helped me to improve my individual working skills, as many of the issues I ran into I had to solve on my own, rather than relying on more experienced developers for assistance. This was actually one of the aspects of the job that I liked the most, as it helped me to be able to solve problems on my own much faster, and more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The first job that I was tasked with was to re-configure, and improve their online price book management system. This is a web application, which had stopped working when they made upgrades to their server. The website was originally developed in PHP, which coming into this work term I had minimal experience with. This task took approximately a month to fully complete. My main task completed was to re-configure the system so then it functioned properly again. Also, I implemented many administration functions such as adding revenue centre groups, and deactivating  revenue centres. This definitely was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about the language of PHP, and what its capabilities are as a language. This task also helped me to improve my problem solving skills, which was accomplished by restoring the system back to its functioning state.</p>
        <p>My next task, which was my main task for the work term, was to re-implement their Online Services website. The Online Services website provides users an interface to purchase accounts, add money to accounts, cancel accounts, and a variety of other features. This website used to be developed in a ColdFusion environment, which was troublesome, as the ColdFusion servers were very unstable, and would go down a lot of the time. My job was to convert this ColdFusion code, into a .NET environment. I would say that the most difficult task in doing this was understanding what the ColdFusion code was doing, and attempting to find an equivalent function in C#, which was the language that I was using to develop the .NET application. During this process, I found that the ColdFusion language itself is very high level, and that many functions which are only one or two lines in ColdFusion can take up to twenty lines in other, more commonly used languages. I was also able to automate some of the features that used to be accomplished by a manual process. One specific function was the transfer of funds component of the system. Originally this process consisted of a request to transfer funds being sent to the administrator, and they would go into the system and complete the transaction manually. Now, the users can do this automatically through the website, which definitely saves administration a lot of time as a result. I would say the most important thing that I learned in completing this task is the ability to convert an entire system over into another language. This required me to have a lot of problem solving skills, and to obtain a lot of knowledge in both the ColdFusion, and in C# languages.</p>
      </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-10 jumbotron">
        <p>My final tasks for my work term consisted of converting other, smaller applications within the Hospitality Services department over into .NET environments as well. These are all applications that were originally developed in ColdFusion or PHP, and needed to be converted to C# to be able to place them in the .NET environment. Some of these applications needed to be rewritten entirely however, such as their Red Top application used to process transactions by the Red Top taxi service. Completing these kinds of tasks was definitely a nice change, as this was the first time in my work term that I wasnâ€™t working with a preexisting  website. Instead, I got to develop these specific applications from scratch, which I quite enjoyed.</p>

        <h1>University of Guelph</h1>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Since my work term with Hospitality Services was only for four months, I had to make sure the goals I set could be accomplished in that time span. My plan when setting my goals was to make sure that I covered areas that I thought needed some improvement, which would help me to succeed in jobs that I have in the future.</p>
        <p>One of the first goals I set was to develop a better learning of web development languages, such as PHP, and languages used in the .NET environment. These were both languages that I had little experience working with previous to this job, so I knew that having success in this job would require me to have a better understanding of how to develop good applications using these languages. I was able to accomplish this goal easily, through analyzing the preexisting code that Hospitality Services used in their websites, as well as through online tutorials beforehand which helped explain to me what the code was doing. The languages that I worked with during this work term were mainly C#, HTML, PHP and ColdFusion, so accomplishing this goal was crucial in my success with this job.</p>
        <p>Another goal that I planned to achieve was to improve my time management skills, which would allow me to work more efficiently, and accomplish tasks before deadlines. I set weekly goals for myself to accomplish throughout my work term, which allowed me to stay on track, and complete all of my assigned tasks with time to spare. I would also meet with my manager every week to go over what I had accomplished, and how that compared to what I had planned to do. Overall, completing this goal has definitely helped me to improve this skill, and will hopefully transfer over into both school projects, and in future jobs as well.</p>
        <p>One of the more important goals that I set was to better my problem solving skills, with respect to coming up with solutions to difficult problems that I may run into when developing applications. Methods for completing this involved researching into how to solve complex problems found in web development, as well as asking my manager for assistance when I ran into difficult problems. One of the first instances of where I used my problem solving skills is when I was debugging the Price Book Management System (PBMS). This was an application that had stopped working, and my job was to fix the errors it was producing. This involved very complex problem solving skills, considering that it was initially unclear of why the application wasnâ€™t working. In the end, I was not only able to fix the system, but I was also able to add administrative functions, which was a desired component that did not currently exist. I believe that this is one of the goals that showed my improvement the most, as I can already see the affect that this goal has had on my ability to solve problems easier.</p>
        <p>The last goal that I set to accomplish was to independently handle, and lead the development of all of the applications that I produced in my work term. Being the only developer in the Hospitality Services department meant that I could not rely on any other developers to assist me if I ran into any issues. This was one of the reasons that I believe that my problem solving skills improved greatly. On a weekly basis, I would also have to meet with my manager to report a status update on the current projects that I had been working on, reporting any barriers that could restrict me from proceeding. One example of this is when I was setting up Single Sign On (SSO). Doing this involved completing numerous tasks, involving setting up an SSL certificate for the website, which I was unable to accomplish by myself, and needed my managerâ€™s assistance in setting that up.</p>
        <p>Overall, the goals that I set to accomplish allowed me to have great success in this job. My co-workers were all very supportive, and provided help, advice and knowledge whenever possible. These goals will not only help me in future work terms, but also in school as well.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Working with the Hospitality Services department gave me valuable real world experience working with numerous applications that are going to be used by all students and faculty at the University of Guelph. I also made connections with my co-workers there, which I believe will be very beneficial in my future success. Previous to this work term, I had very minimal experience in development, which is what made this role perfect for me. I was given the opportunity to learn and develop in a variety of different languages, which will benefit me when finding new jobs in the future. Being the sole developer and tester for these tasks also helped me to further learn the importance of thoroughly testing the software you produce. I will definitely be able to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in this job into both my school work, and in future development jobs that I have.</p>
