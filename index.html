          <p>Hi! My name is Adam Reid. I am currently in my final year of a Bachelors of Computing degree, majoring in computer science. I have just completed my last co-op term, this time with the Brock Solutions as a Software Developer. My interests are in back-end development, and information security. One area where I would like to expand my knowledge is in mobile development.</p>
          <p>I am currently pursuing a minor in mathematics, which helps my ability to problem solve very easily. I apply this knowledge constantly in the applications that I develop.</p>
          <p>My goal for this website is to provide information and insight on what it is like to work in software development roles in different companies.</p>

        <h1>The Co-operators</h1>
        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>The Co-operators, is an insurance company that was formed in Canada in 1945. It was originally built by farmers to take care of themselves because traditional insurers did not meet their needs at the time. They provide a number of different services to this day, such as auto, home, and commercial insurance. Currently, The Co-operators have over a million clients across the Canada. I worked at the Co-operators head office, which is located in downtown Guelph, Ontario.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-10 jumbotron block-blue">
        <h2>About My Role</h2>
        <p>My main job at The Co-operators was as a Quality Assurance Analyst. I worked on a QA team of testers, along with the entire document solutions team, to ensure that all of the documents produced from the system were accurate, and correct. The system that produces these documents is called Guidewire PolicyCenter, so my main job was to ensure that all of the information that was entered in PolicyCenter correctly printed on the documents that will go out towards their clients. During my time there, our team thoroughly tested all aspect of the Automotive insurance documents, performing many different types of tests to do so, including system integration testing, regression testing, black box testing, and white box testing. Near the end of my term, I was asked to look into the possibility of using an program called Selenium to automate our testing process during the regression stages. By the end of my term, I had successfully created an automation script that simulates a policy being created using a set of data in an Excel document. This script will be used in the future, as they develop further into this program, and the benefits it can have on the team’s testing process.</p>
        <p>Another task that I was assigned to work on was the testing of a software upgrade called Prinova MessagePoint. This software was used, along with their Guidewire software, to produce the documents that my team reviewed. I was trusted to individually test this upgraded software, in order to ensure that it did not interfere with the correct composition of the policy documents. The testing for this upgrade took a total of about a month, which consisted of gathering information about the upgrade, gathering test samples, and performing all required test cases that I had created to be sure that the entire system worked with no difference to the previously upgraded one. By the end of the testing period, I successfully reported any and all defects found in my testing, had them fixed by the Prinova developers, and confirmed that all errors have been fixed.</p>

        <h1>The Co-operators</h1>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Through the first four months of my work term, the goals I made were pretty generic, and focused on essential skills that I knew would help me further on in my career as well. One of the goals I had was to improve on communicating my thoughts and opinions effectively to my fellow team members. A method for completing this goal was to actively participate more in group meetings and discussions. Another goal I had was to develop better testing strategies by exploring unique and creative ways to test software efficiently. One way I would achieve this goal was to use a variety of new testing strategies and techniques learned by shadowing other team members while they test. My third goal was to collaborate with team members to accomplish more difficult tasks. Throughout the term, I actively participated in many group projects, which helped me to accomplish this goal. The last term specific goal that I had for the summer was to learn and develop a better understanding of software testing techniques and methodologies. Thanks to my manager Venkat, who lead many different learning sessions for the team, I was able to achieve this goal very quickly.</p>
        <p>Through the second half of my work term, the goals I made were more specific to the type of job I would be doing. My first goal was to summarize my work at the Co-operators, to help me reflect on my experiences and learning throughout my work term. With the help of Venkat, I was thankfully able to learn a lot, which I incorporated into my summary. Another goal I had was to independently perform the testing on a small project. My job was to test that all documents were produced as expected during a software upgrade. I was responsible for completing a test plan, test cases, defect reporting, and conducting the test cases, in order to ensure that the software worked correctly. The third goal I had was to create an automated test script, which will eventually be used as a template so then automated testing can be used on a regular basis during regression testing. I successfully created and demonstrated my test case script automation, which produced a policy based on a set of data, along with a couple other useful automated test scripts as well.</p>
        <p>One goal that I made throughout my entire work term was to learn more about corporate work culture, and specifically the work culture at The Co-operators. In order to achieve this goal, I completed courses on The Co-operators learning website, as well as I participated in learning sessions provided, and researched more about the topic in my free time. This definitely helped me to  better understand the true benefits of working in a corporate company, and the Co-operators industry work culture.</p>
        <p>Overall, each one of the goals that I made and completed helped me to get the most learning out of my time while I was there. My co-workers were very supportive of my goals, and were willing to provide help, advice and knowledge whenever possible.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In Conclusion, working at The Co-operators was definitely a great experience for me. Not only did I make a lot of connections with my co-workers there, but I also gained valuable experience with learning better test methods and strategies. Knowing the importance of thoroughly testing code was one of the most significant things I took away from working there. One reason why I chose to work at The Co-operators was because I thought that it would be a good job to start with. Another reason is because I thought it would teach me how to test my code properly, and it definitely did exactly that. I am already applying what I learned there into my school work, and my personal coding projects, and I am sure that I will definitely help me in the future as well.</p>

        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>Hospitality Services is the department in the University of Guelph, and is a recognized leader for quality and innovation in Canadian University food services. The Hospitality Services IT department deals with a variety of different jobs, including ensuring that meal cards are working, and processing transactions made on a daily basis.

        <h2>About My Role</h2>
        <p>One thing that was particularly different about the role I had was that I was the sole individual responsible for both the development and testing that I completed in my work term. Being in this situation provided me with a lot of work to do, and a lot of responsibility as well. This helped me to improve my individual working skills, as many of the issues I ran into I had to solve on my own, rather than relying on more experienced developers for assistance. This was actually one of the aspects of the job that I liked the most, as it helped me to be able to solve problems on my own much faster, and more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The first job that I was tasked with was to re-configure, and improve their online price book management system. This is a web application, which had stopped working when they made upgrades to their server. The website was originally developed in PHP, which coming into this work term I had minimal experience with. This task took approximately a month to fully complete. My main task completed was to re-configure the system so then it functioned properly again. Also, I implemented many administration functions such as adding revenue centre groups, and deactivating  revenue centres. This definitely was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about the language of PHP, and what its capabilities are as a language. This task also helped me to improve my problem solving skills, which was accomplished by restoring the system back to its functioning state.</p>
        <p>My next task, which was my main task for the work term, was to re-implement their Online Services website. The Online Services website provides users an interface to purchase accounts, add money to accounts, cancel accounts, and a variety of other features. This website used to be developed in a ColdFusion environment, which was troublesome, as the ColdFusion servers were very unstable, and would go down a lot of the time. My job was to convert this ColdFusion code, into a .NET environment. I would say that the most difficult task in doing this was understanding what the ColdFusion code was doing, and attempting to find an equivalent function in C#, which was the language that I was using to develop the .NET application. During this process, I found that the ColdFusion language itself is very high level, and that many functions which are only one or two lines in ColdFusion can take up to twenty lines in other, more commonly used languages. I was also able to automate some of the features that used to be accomplished by a manual process. One specific function was the transfer of funds component of the system. Originally this process consisted of a request to transfer funds being sent to the administrator, and they would go into the system and complete the transaction manually. Now, the users can do this automatically through the website, which definitely saves administration a lot of time as a result. I would say the most important thing that I learned in completing this task is the ability to convert an entire system over into another language. This required me to have a lot of problem solving skills, and to obtain a lot of knowledge in both the ColdFusion, and in C# languages.</p>
      </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-10 jumbotron block-blue">
        <p>My final tasks for my work term consisted of converting other, smaller applications within the Hospitality Services department over into .NET environments as well. These are all applications that were originally developed in ColdFusion or PHP, and needed to be converted to C# to be able to place them in the .NET environment. Some of these applications needed to be rewritten entirely however, such as their Red Top application used to process transactions by the Red Top taxi service. Completing these kinds of tasks was definitely a nice change, as this was the first time in my work term that I wasn’t working with a preexisting  website. Instead, I got to develop these specific applications from scratch, which I quite enjoyed.</p>

        <h1>University of Guelph</h1>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Since my work term with Hospitality Services was only for four months, I had to make sure the goals I set could be accomplished in that time span. My plan when setting my goals was to make sure that I covered areas that I thought needed some improvement, which would help me to succeed in jobs that I have in the future.</p>
        <p>One of the first goals I set was to develop a better learning of web development languages, such as PHP, and languages used in the .NET environment. These were both languages that I had little experience working with previous to this job, so I knew that having success in this job would require me to have a better understanding of how to develop good applications using these languages. I was able to accomplish this goal easily, through analyzing the preexisting code that Hospitality Services used in their websites, as well as through online tutorials beforehand which helped explain to me what the code was doing. The languages that I worked with during this work term were mainly C#, HTML, PHP and ColdFusion, so accomplishing this goal was crucial in my success with this job.</p>
        <p>Another goal that I planned to achieve was to improve my time management skills, which would allow me to work more efficiently, and accomplish tasks before deadlines. I set weekly goals for myself to accomplish throughout my work term, which allowed me to stay on track, and complete all of my assigned tasks with time to spare. I would also meet with my manager every week to go over what I had accomplished, and how that compared to what I had planned to do. Overall, completing this goal has definitely helped me to improve this skill, and will hopefully transfer over into both school projects, and in future jobs as well.</p>
        <p>One of the more important goals that I set was to better my problem solving skills, with respect to coming up with solutions to difficult problems that I may run into when developing applications. Methods for completing this involved researching into how to solve complex problems found in web development, as well as asking my manager for assistance when I ran into difficult problems. One of the first instances of where I used my problem solving skills is when I was debugging the Price Book Management System (PBMS). This was an application that had stopped working, and my job was to fix the errors it was producing. This involved very complex problem solving skills, considering that it was initially unclear of why the application wasn’t working. In the end, I was not only able to fix the system, but I was also able to add administrative functions, which was a desired component that did not currently exist. I believe that this is one of the goals that showed my improvement the most, as I can already see the affect that this goal has had on my ability to solve problems easier.</p>
        <p>The last goal that I set to accomplish was to independently handle, and lead the development of all of the applications that I produced in my work term. Being the only developer in the Hospitality Services department meant that I could not rely on any other developers to assist me if I ran into any issues. This was one of the reasons that I believe that my problem solving skills improved greatly. On a weekly basis, I would also have to meet with my manager to report a status update on the current projects that I had been working on, reporting any barriers that could restrict me from proceeding. One example of this is when I was setting up Single Sign On (SSO). Doing this involved completing numerous tasks, involving setting up an SSL certificate for the website, which I was unable to accomplish by myself, and needed my manager’s assistance in setting that up.</p>
        <p>Overall, the goals that I set to accomplish allowed me to have great success in this job. My co-workers were all very supportive, and provided help, advice and knowledge whenever possible. These goals will not only help me in future work terms, but also in school as well.</p>

        <p>Working with the Hospitality Services department gave me valuable real world experience working with numerous applications that are going to be used by all students and faculty at the University of Guelph. I also made connections with my co-workers there, which I believe will be very beneficial in my future success. Previous to this work term, I had very minimal experience in development, which is what made this role perfect for me. I was given the opportunity to learn and develop in a variety of different languages, which will benefit me when finding new jobs in the future. Being the sole developer and tester for these tasks also helped me to further learn the importance of thoroughly testing the software you produce. I will definitely be able to apply what I’ve learned in this job into both my school work, and in future development jobs that I have.</p>

        <p>Brock Solutions is a company that provides a variety of engineering solutions and services to their clients. They operate under three main sectors: transportation and logistics, manufacturing, and panel fabrication services. Brock has over 400 employees in both Canada and the United States, and has been in business for over 30 years. Brock has been a continual winner of the Canada’s 50 Best Managed Company Awards since 1996. They also provide sponsorships for numerous Brock sports teams such as slo-pitch, hockey, and volleyball. I worked in one of their main offices, which is located in Kitchener, Ontario.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-10 jumbotron block-blue">
        <h2>About My Role</h2>
        <p>My role in Brock Solutions was to be a Software Developer. Initially, I was the main developer, and worked alongside my project manager Ryan. In this circumstance, I would provide the majority of development services, and Ryan would help out with minor additions, and conduct code reviews on the work that I had done to ensure that it was meeting Brock’s coding standards. The project that I worked on was to make an operations management system for one of the clients of Brock. The purpose of this system was to keep track of scheduling, employee statistics, and equipment status, as well as allow users to configure employee and equipment information. During this part of my work term, I was able to become more comfortable with my independent working skills, as most of my work did not involve interacting with other co-workers, other than my manager when I needed assistance.</p>
        <p>The software development tool that was used to make this type of application is called Ignition. Ignition allows for developers to design a Java-like application, using a ‘drag-and-drop’ like UI development style for the front-end, and using scripting languages for the back-end. The scripting in the back-end was mainly done in a language called Jython, which is Python for the most part, but also includes the ability to incorporate Java libraries if needed. Ignition makes it very easy to rapidly develop complex applications, which is beneficial especially when in a small timeframe to deliver a product. Using this tool also allows for developers to incorporate pre-built modules made for Ignition, which provide services such as data recording, reporting, and alarming. Along with using Ignition for the front-end and back-end work, the project also involved using SQL for data recording and querying. I definitely learned a lot more about SQL than I had previously known from the start of this term, as the complexity of queries that I had to write was at a much higher level than I had ever needed to know in previous work terms and in school.</p>
        <p>Closer to the end of my work term, the number of Ignition projects that my team was involved with increased. These types of projects were similar to that of the first project I worked on, where clients required a type of management application for their employees or their equipment. To be able to complete these projects on time, the team I was on grew to include more developers. During this part of my work term, I was also used as a resource to new developers. Since I had spent the majority of my work term using Ignition, I knew a lot more about what capabilities it had. With this knowledge, I feel that I was able to decrease the time it took to get new team members comfortable with Ignition, which allowed them to start developing almost immediately. Working with more team members definitely helped me to improve my teamwork and communication skills, as I was consistently helping co-workers to help solve any of their problems that they were having.</p>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Since I was in an eight-month co-op work term, I made four goals that I was to accomplish for each four-month term that I had, for a total of eight goals. In doing this I felt like I would be able to cover a wider variety of goals. Furthermore, after my first four months, I would have a better idea of the type of work I would be doing. This would allow me to make goals that are directed more at that specific type of work.</p>
        <p>For the first four months, one of my goals was to further my knowledge in programming in at least one of the languages that was used at Brock Solutions. Coming into the job, I knew that they used Java, and I had known when making this goal that I would be working with Python as well, so I decided that I would work towards learning more about those languages. I felt that doing this would help me to become a better developer, which would also help me to acquire future jobs that dealt with similar types of languages. While completing this goal, I was researching online, and consulting Brock resources to improve my knowledge of the two languages. By the end of my four months, I was consistently implementing my own code into the applications that I had made, as well as previously made projects that needed modifications.</p>
        <p>One skill that I felt would be very beneficial for me to work towards improving on while at Brock was to improve my teamwork skills. For the most part, in both school and previous work terms, I did not have that much experience working with groups on projects. Completing this goal would not only mean that I would have more skill working with others, but it would also improve my communication skills with team members as well. During the first four months, I was not able work on many larger teams. However, Brock offers a variety of different social activities, such as weekly basketball, barbeques, and team ‘lunch and learns’, which I felt really helped me to get comfortable around other co-workers who I did not normally work with on a regular basis. Especially with basketball, where teamwork is crucial in a team’s success, I felt that I was able to definitely improve on this skill, which can be applied into the work environment as well.</p>
        <p>Considering that I knew I would be working with the Ignition software tool for the majority of my co-op term, I felt that it would be in my best interest to make it a goal of mine to learn as much as I could about the software. One of the first things that helped with this was that Inductive Automation, the company that developed Ignition, offers online courses which included videos and evaluations that test your knowledge of the software. The first couple weeks of my work term was almost completely dedicated to completing all of the courses that Inductive Automation had to offer. That, combined with the fact that I was using the software on a regular basis, really helped me to solidify my knowledge of the software. By the end of my first four months, I knew more about the software and what its capabilities were, which allowed for me to make better decisions in terms of the design of the applications that I was going to be making. This also helped the team later on, when new developers were joining. I was able to provide to them useful resources that I had found that would be most relevant to the work that they would be doing.</p>
        <p>A goal that I am always continuing to try and improve is my written communication skills. Specifically, for the start of my work term, I wanted to try and get better at communicating the type of work that I was completing. In doing this, I would be able to better describe to customers the different aspects of the work that I do, which will give them more confidence that my team is properly completing the projects they have for us. Each week when submitting timesheets, I was required to write a sentence for each of the different tasks that I completed the previous week. Furthermore, for each project-related document that I wrote, I would review it to ensure that what I wrote matched exactly with I was trying to explain. I would also comment my code in areas where there may be some confusion, so then both myself and other developers can look at the code and immediately tell what function it is completing. This is definitely a skill that I feel improved over my entire work term, and will be useful in all aspects of my life, including future jobs that I have.</p>
        <p>During the second half of my work term, one skill that I wanted to improve on was my ability to write quality requirement documents and specifications. In the four months that had passed, I had realized that I was not very comfortable producing these types of documents, and I knew that I would need to improve this skill in order to succeed in this position. The feedback that I obtained from my manager and fellow team members really helped me to identify key areas of improvement for me, which I worked to improve on by the end of my work term. I also took the time to look at previous requirements documents that have been made by Brock, to see if there was anything that I have been missing in my documents. I have produced many different types of specification documents since making this goal, and have had them both self-reviewed and peer-reviewed to ensure that they were correct and appropriate to share with our customers.</p>
        <p>Something I chose to continue working towards improving throughout the rest of my entire eight-month work term was to improve my teamwork skills. Since I was rarely on a team with more than two people for the first half of the term, I thought it would be best to continue working towards completing this goal, especially with respect to working with a larger team. Thankfully, in the second half of my term the team I was on grew to about seven people, with most of them being co-workers I had no experience working with. Each day, we participated in scrum meetings to discuss what we were working on, and noting any potential roadblocks that might be a concern. On a consistent basis, I provided my opinions and thoughts towards possible solutions to problems or concerns that other team members had. Outside of work, I continued to participate in sporting events with Brock employees, such as basketball, volleyball, and ping pong.</p>
        <p>Since by this time I had already developed a solid understanding of the Ignition software, it made sense for me to look toward extending my knowledge of the tool. To do this, I decided to look into external, and third party modules that can be imported and used in Ignition. I conducted research into a variety of tools, such as a barcode scanner, downtime, and production related modules. For each one that I researched, I produced an analysis document, which outlined the functionality and capabilities of the modules, and concluding if the module can be used in any current projects. Along with that, I would try to extend the functionality of Ignition by looking into unconventional ways to complete complicated tasks. An example of this is with customized pop-up windows that are synchronous to the main windows in Ignition. To try and overcome the inability to complete this using basic techniques, I would look into Ignition functions that could be utilized in a certain way to complete this task effectively. At the end of my co-op term, I had felt that I learned most, if not all of what could be accomplished using Ignition, including what can be done with third party modules.</p>
        <p>One skill that I had struggled to improve on during previous work terms was to work on my oral communication skills, specifically directed at presenting what I have done to groups of people. Leading presentations has always been something that I have been uncomfortable doing in the past. I also knew that to be able to succeed as an employee at Brock, I would need to improve on this skill to be able to adequately present applications to clients and potential customers. During the second half of my term, I was the main presenter in two factory acceptance tests, one of which I got to travel on-site and present to the customer face-to-face. These types of presentations lasted anywhere from three to four hours. Furthermore, at the end of my co-op, the other students and I presented information about what we worked on at Brock. This was done over Skype, and was shared with over forty employees that work at Brock. I not only believe that I have become more comfortable with leading presentations, but I have also improved the quality of my presentations, which was my ideal outcome of this goal.</p>
        <p>Overall, the goals that I set to accomplish allowed me to have great success in this job. My fellow team members were all very supportive, provided help, and gave knowledge whenever possible. These goals will hopefully be able to help me not only with jobs that I have in the future, but possibly in school as well.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Working at Brock Solutions was definitely one of my favourite and most enjoyable co-op work terms while at the University of Guelph. I was able to obtain valuable skills that are transferrable to many different aspects of my life outside of the working environment. I also made connections with my co-workers there, which I believe will be very beneficial in my future success. This role gave me a good combination of both working independently and working in a team environment. Being able to work independently while still having the ability to go to co-workers for help when needed was something that I had been specifically looking for in a job. Working at Brock also further expanded my knowledge in programming languages, especially with ones I had minimal experience with, which is going to help me in any software development related work that I do in the future. I will be able to apply what I have learned in this job into both my school work, and in my development jobs.</p>
